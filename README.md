# to-do-list
Basic Javascript project, to learn about the DOM (traversal and manipulation), event handlers and listeners.
The focus is not on the best designed and prettiest page, but to demonstrate that I've learnt and understood these core concepts.

# Approach
I managed to get a basic functioning demo working, that allows a user to input text into the field, and click the button to add a task to a list. It also has error handling, showing a text prompt if the user leaves the text field empty and clicks the button.

# Further work
I need to add some styling and positioning, as it doesn't have any CSS yet.
Also looking into additional functionality, to allow the user to delete tasks from the list.
