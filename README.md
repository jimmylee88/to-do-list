# to-do-list
Basic Javascript project, to learn about the DOM (traversal and manipulation), event handlers and listeners.
The focus is not on the best designed and prettiest page, but to demonstrate that I've learnt and understood these core concepts.

# Approach
I managed to get a basic functioning demo working, that allows a user to input text into the field, and click the button to add a task to a list. It also has error handling, showing a text prompt if the user leaves the text field empty and clicks the button.

# Further work
I added the ability to delete a task from the list once it's been added.
Going to do some basic styling, so that it least sits centred in the page.

Some features I'd like to add if I have time, and gain the skills to know:
- Remember your tasks even after a browser refresh
- Ability to edit tasks after they're added to the list
- Ability to check off tasks, rather than delete them entirely
