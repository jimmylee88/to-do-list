# To-do-list
Beginners Javascript project, to learn about the DOM (traversal and manipulation), event handlers and listeners.

# Features
I managed to get a basic functioning demo working, that allows a user to:
- Input text into the field, and click the "Add Task" button to add a task to a list. 
- Get a text prompt if the user leaves the text field empty and clicks the button.
- Delete a task from the list

# Further work
I added the ability to delete a task from the list once it's been added.
Going to do some basic styling, so that it least sits centred in the page.

Some features I'd like to add if I have time, and learn more javascript:
- Remember your tasks even after a browser refresh
- Ability to edit tasks after they're added to the list
- Ability to check off tasks, rather than delete them entirely
